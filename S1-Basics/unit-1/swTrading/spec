Implement and use a 960px twelve column grid system using the float: left; approach. Code for your grid should go in a separate stylesheet.

Modify the existing index.html as necessary to achieve the layout.

Add a main.css file for any styles you need to achieve the layout. The CSS for your grid, however, should not go in this file.

When the screen width is less than 640px, columns should take up 100% of their parent container's width, but there should continue to be padding between the card and the edge of the viewport.

When the screen is 640px or wider, the columns should take up the correct width.
When the screen is wider than 1000px, the grid should stop expanding, and it should be centered in the browser window.

The page should be SEO- and accessibility-friendly. From now on, these should be default requirements for every page you create.
