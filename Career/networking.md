Networking mindset exercise: This is a self-reflective exercise that only requires you to think. When you think about connecting with others in your new tech field, what comes to mind? Is this something that youâ€™re excited about? Are you anxious? Are you nervous? Take about 5 - 10 minutes to assess your thoughts and feelings about networking.

When I think about connecting with people, it's definitely a mixed bag. I worked in the tech industry in Seattle half a decade ago (as a marketing guy), so culturally I know some of the ins and outs. I was specifically in the start up community, and right now I'm looking for more of a job-job, so I don't know how much overlap their is in culture. I talked for a living while I was running a comedy club... so I'm fine talking, when I know people want to listen. But when I'm just plopped into a room I'm more of a listener. So the idea of putting myself out there is a little daunting.

Identify 3 local networking opportunities you plan to attend and 3 tech professionals in your area you want to connect with. Add them to the Careers - Getting Started document.

Done.
